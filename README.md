At [r/roguelikedev](https://reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/wiki/python_tutorial_series) we're doing a dev-along following [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial.](http://rogueliketutorials.com/libtcod/1) Come and check this out!

I'll be diverging a bit from the main Python tutorial by implementing Esper's entity component system. I'll be also using python-tcod for it's new console class, and numpy arrays for the game map. 
 
## Current Features
